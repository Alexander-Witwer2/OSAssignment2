DOCUMENTATION

This program is implementing the Baker's Algorithm in C++

I used a cpp and an hpp file as well as using an input file to take in the allocation, max, and availiable matrices. 
Also there is a function used to calculate the Need matrix to make the Banker's Algortihm work.

There is a print function mainly for debugging, but also to show off each matrix.

I used a class called Banker in order to implement the Banker's Algorithm.
The constructor used takes in an ifstream to create the aforementioned matrices. 

I used a number of arrays in the actual algorithm to keep track of everything.

The variables resNum and procNum correspond to the process number and the resource number.
The algorithm can only currently take in a matrix that is 5X3, but this can be changed if the previously mentioned variables are changed.
No dynamic allocation for this program.
